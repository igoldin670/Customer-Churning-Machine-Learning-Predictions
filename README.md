#Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using Python, leveraging the power of pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn (sklearn) for machine learning modeling. 
Churn prediction is vital for businesses to identify customers who are at risk of leaving, enabling targeted interventions to improve retention.
This was just a simple fun project that I wanted to do and show off for other people to use or try.
